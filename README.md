# R Subsetting Bug: Empty Subset Due to Incorrect Logical Condition

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames using logical conditions. The bug arises from an incorrectly specified condition that unintentionally results in an empty subset, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in further data processing.

## Bug Description
The provided R code attempts to select a subset of a data frame based on a logical condition. However, the condition is incorrectly formulated, leading to the retrieval of an empty subset. This can easily be overlooked and cause significant issues in the subsequent analysis or operations if not carefully examined.

## Bug Solution
The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly specify the logical condition to retrieve the intended subset of the data frame. This involves carefully reviewing the values present in the relevant column to identify the appropriate comparison criteria.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.r` file and run the code. Observe the empty data frame output.
3. Open the `bugSolution.r` file and run the code. Observe the correctly subsetted data frame output.

## Additional Notes
This is a common issue encountered when working with R data frames.  Pay close attention to your logical conditions when subsetting data to prevent unexpected behavior. Always inspect and test your subsets to ensure they are correct before proceeding with further analysis.
